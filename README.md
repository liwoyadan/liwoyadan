**i mostly do frontend shenanigans but i touch backend stuff now and then. you'll usually see me working with lorekeeper stuff and sometimes building & deploying static sites with repos using 11ty.** it's probably prudent to keep in mind i'm quite ill, don't always code with my hands (occasionally talon voice/utterly voice), and can't stay upright for too long so i may take longer than average depending on the work; if you need something fast from me let me know beforehand so i can see about prioritizing it!

:star2: **want to toss me a few bucks?**

> :coffee: you can find my **ko-fi** here: <https://ko-fi.com/alyeong>

<sup>helps me afford my regular IV fluids and immunotherapy so i can continue to do stuff. ‚ù§Ô∏è</sup>
